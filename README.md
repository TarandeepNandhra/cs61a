# CS61a - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Introductory Computer Science course in Python.

To further my development, I completed a university introductory computer science course indepedently online as I am passionate about learning more and furthering my coding skills.

Main Ideas: Abstraction, Object oriented and functional programming.
Key concepts: Recursion, higher order functions, tree recursion, list comprehension and generators.

I completed several mini projects, the highlight being an [Ants Game](https://github.com/taran314/cs61a/tree/master/ants).
I also completed several problem sets which focus on key programming concepts. The most recent commits give an overview of what was covered and code within each file is in the .py file with comments.
